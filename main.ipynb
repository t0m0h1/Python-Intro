    "Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for **web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and more**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some key features of Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to read and write:** Python uses clear, English-like syntax, making it beginner-friendly.\n",
    "- **Interpreted:** You can run Python code directly without compiling it first.\n",
    "- **Dynamically typed:** You don’t need to declare variable types; Python figures them out automatically.\n",
    "- **Versatile:** Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including **procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming**.\n",
    "- **Large standard library and community:** Python comes with many built-in modules, and there are countless external libraries available for specialized tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will start by exploring **Python’s core data structures** and how they are used to store and manipulate data efficiently.\n"

    "## 1. Lists\n",
    "A Python list is one of the most commonly used data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms:\n",
    "- It's an ordered collection of items.\n",
    "- It can hold any type of data: numbers, strings, booleans, or even other lists.\n",
    "- It is mutable, which means you can change, add, or remove items after creating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a row of boxes, where each box has a number (called an index) starting from 0, and you can put anything inside, take things out, or swap them around.\n"
